# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository for Zsh, managed with the Zsh Plugin Manager (ZPM). This setup is designed to streamline my shell environment with custom configurations, functions, and themes for Zsh.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have `zsh` installed on your system. ZPM will be used to manage Zsh plugins and themes.

## Installation

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zpm-shell/zpm-dotfiles-template/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and customize your own Zsh environment. If you have suggestions or improvements, pull requests are welcome.
